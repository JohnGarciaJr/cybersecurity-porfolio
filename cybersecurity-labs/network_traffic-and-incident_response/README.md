📄 Included Files
1. Security incident report (HTTP)
Analyzes an incident involving malicious file downloads delivered over HTTP. The report documents how users were redirected to a fraudulent website and how a brute force attack likely led to unauthorized administrative access.
2. Cybersecurity incident report (SYN Flooding)
Explains a denial‑of‑service event caused by SYN flooding. The report breaks down the TCP three‑way handshake and describes how excessive SYN packets overwhelmed the server’s resources.
3. Cybersecurity incident report (Network Traffic Analysis)
Investigate DNS and ICMP traffic to diagnose why customers received “destination port unreachable” errors. The analysis identifies issues with DNS port 53 and explores potential causes such as misconfiguration or a DoS attack.
4. tcpdump traffic log
A raw packet capture is used to analyze HTTP, DNS, and ICMP behavior. This log supports the findings in the incident reports and provides evidence of redirects, DNS lookups, and protocol‑level anomalies.
5. Security risk assessment report (Hardening Tools)
Evaluates security hardening tools such as password policies, MFA, and network access privileges. The report provides recommendations to reduce brute force risk, strengthen authentication, and limit unauthorized access.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Packet capture analysis using tcpdump
- Identification of network protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS)
- Detection of malicious redirects and suspicious traffic patterns
- Understanding of SYN flooding and DoS attack behavior
- Incident documentation and root cause analysis
- Security hardening and access control recommendations
- Clear, professional reporting aligned with SOC and IR workflows

🎯 Summary
This collection showcases the ability to analyze real network traffic, identify multiple types of attacks, and document findings in a structured, professional format. The reports demonstrate a strong understanding of network fundamentals, attack vectors, and practical incident response techniques. 
These exercises reflect the analytical mindset and technical skills required for roles in SOC operations, network security, and cybersecurity analysis.
