# NIST CSF Mapping Project

This project demonstrates alignment between organizational controls and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).  
It includes:

- **NIST-CSF-Mapping.md** – A structured mapping of controls to CSF functions and categories.  
- **Gap-Assessment.md** – A sample gap analysis identifying improvement opportunities.  

These artifacts reflect common compliance activities performed by cybersecurity governance teams and illustrate a practical understanding of control frameworks.
