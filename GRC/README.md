# Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Portfolio

This repository showcases practical, documentation-driven GRC work aligned in industry frameworks such as NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and PCI DSS. 
It is organized into three core domains:

## Governance
Policies, standards, procedures, data governance artifacts, and governance tooling models.

## Risk
Risk registers, assessments, threat modeling, and business impact analysis.

## Compliance
Framework mappings, gap assessments, and system security documentation.

Each folder contains real-world style artifacts designed to demonstrate systems thinking, documentation clarity, and practical GR capability.
