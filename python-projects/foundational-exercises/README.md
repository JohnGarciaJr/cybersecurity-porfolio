# Foundational Python Exercises

This folder contains introductory Python exercises completed during my early programming practice. These small projects demonstrate core skills such as user input handling, conditional logic, control flow, and basic problem-solving.

## Included Exercises

### 1. Triathlon Award Program
A simple Python script that determines which award a triathlon competitor receives based on their finishing time. This exercise reinforces:
- Conditional statements
- Range checking
- User input handling
- Basic program structure

Additional foundational exercises will be added to this folder as I continue expanding my Python skills.
