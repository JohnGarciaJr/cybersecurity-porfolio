📘 Finance Calculator (Python)
A simple command-line program that calculates either:
- Simple or compound interest on an investment
- Monthly repayment amounts on a home loan (bond)
This project was developed as part of my ASU Cybersecurity Bootcamp to strengthen foundational Python skills, including variables, control structures, user input handling, and mathematical operations.

🚀 Features
Investment Calculator
- Accepts deposit amount
- Accepts interest rate (percentage)
- Accepts investment duration (years)
- Supports simple or compound interest
- Outputs the final amount to two decimal places
Bond (Home Loan) Calculator
- Accepts the present value of the house
- Accepts annual interest rate
- Accepts repayment duration (months)
- Calculates monthly repayment using the standard amortization formula

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals
- Variables and data types
- Conditional logic (if/elif/else)
- User input handling
- Mathematical formulas
- Basic error handling
- Clean code structure and commenting
- Use of the math module

🛠️ How to Run the Program
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- Download or clone this repository.
- Open a terminal in the project folder.
- Run the script:
- Follow the on-screen prompts to choose:
- investment or bond
- For investments: simple or compound interest

🎯 Purpose of This Project
This project is part of my early Python development work in the ASU Cybersecurity Bootcamp. It demonstrates my ability to:
- Translate requirements into working code
- Apply formulas programmatically
- Build user-friendly command-line tools
- Document and structure a project for GitHub
It also serves as the first entry in my growing cybersecurity and Python Portfolio.

📄 Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Input validation for non-numeric values
- Looping menu to allow multiple calculations
- Error handling for invalid selections
- Optional export of results to a text file
